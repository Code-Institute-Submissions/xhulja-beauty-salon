* __Site Owner Goals__:

# User Requirements and Expectations

  * __Requirements__:


   * Navigate the website using the navbar which should be clear and hierarchical.
  
   * Be provided with information of different services of the salon.

   * Contact Form validation to help against spam.







  * __Expectations__:

  * Content is visually satisfying and informative.
  
  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website.

  * Form Validation works correctly.


# Design Choices

* __Fonts__:
  
  I will use the font [LATO](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) as it  a very simple style which provides the easiest
   nature of the overall site design.
   
    The focus of the content is to provide an informative experience for the customer,
     so i think this is the right font for my project.

* __Icons__:
  
  The icons used are self explanatory , so easy for users to interpret what the icon will actually do. 
  I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons.
 I had to make sure that the icon was perfect size on smaller devices to ensure easy access.

* __Colors__:
  
   Purple colour is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, 
   playful, cute, romantic, charming, and tenderness,
    is associated with flowers, and sweetness. 
    I think is best  colour for beauty salon websites.

   * Primary: #5c2751 "__Purple__" i chose this as primary colour because i think
   is perfect for influencing cuteness and charm.

   * Secondary: #4c1741 "__Dark Purple__"  Purple combines the stability of the blue color and the energy of the red. Through the ages, purple has always been associated with royalty, nobility and prestige. The color purple can symbolize mystery, magic, power and luxury.
  
   * Tertiary: #9dacff  "__Lilac__" ilac is a shade of purple that can be achieved by mixing white, red and blue. It has been fortified by knowledge and softened through experience. With regards to intensity, this may appear to be closely related to pink. Lilac color meaning can be related to tranquility, peace, and friendship.
  
   * Navigation colour: #76e5fc "__Light Blue__" Light blue is a peaceful, calming color. According to color psychology, blue is associated with trustworthiness and reliability. Blue is also said to promote feelings of tranquility; light blue’s gentle appearance means it is particularly likely to make that impression.

   _Colors_:

   * $primary-color: #5c2751; rgb(92, 39, 81);
   * $secondary-color: #4c1741; rgb(76, 23, 65);
   * $tertiary-color: #9dacff; rgb(157, 172, 255);
   * $navigation-color: #76e5fc; rgb(118, 229, 252);

* __Background__:
  
  The images i used for home page are real pictures made in my work,
  because i think is good way of showing to clients what we offer.


 * __Images__:
  
   I used real pictures of my work converted with [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)


## Wireframes:

I built Wireframes using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.cloud/sezg2vv/p6gs2pk).  
It was very simple design just to get the idea how is going to look the structure of the page in different devices.
 


## Languages:

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)


[CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)



## Tools & Libraries

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://maps.google.com/)
* [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [TinyPng](https://tinypng.com/) __(image compression)__

## Testing: 

This was my first project, my testing was extremely thorough, making sure that i checked every line of code  ran without issues. Testing was done by me and double checked by my mentor.

* Test Planning:
 During planning for this project i knew that i needed to make sure that every code is raning well during and after the project is completed.
 Wireframes were good help at how i will create the layouts, organise each section and follow my testing guide to check that it had been implemented correctly and works as i was expecting.

* Testing Stories:

I ran into an issue with how I was using the full links of pictures implemented in my project, but this way was not making the code works as i wanted so i used the relative paths to fix the issue.
Another issue was that i was working with two branches, but thanks to the pull request option i made it work in one branch and the site works well.

 * Responsiveness -

Plan : I knew that this project needed to be FULLY responsive and mobile friendly. I used Bootstrap which is very helpful and making the HTML works well.
Implementation : Making sure that i was using the correct class attributes so my code will ran correctly, this was very easy way thanks to use of Bootstrap.
Result : The Responsiveness of the site works as expected, the site can be viewed in any device.
Verdict : This test has passed and  the site is responsive.

* Design -

Plan :I tryed to keep simple design and using good colours and images. Using colours like purple and light blue  provides great contrast .  Using sites like w3schools.com allowed me to search for the perfect colours.
Implementation : Adding this colours was good choice and they were responsive.
Result : The theme of the site matching well with this colours.
Verdict : This test has passed and colours are perfect for the purpose of the site.

* Form Validation -

Plan : Making the plan of this project i wanted  to include simple form validation on the contact form.
